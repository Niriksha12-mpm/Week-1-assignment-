Install a Python library of your choice within your Colab notebook (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). 
Write code to demonstrate the usage of the installed library. 
Perform a basic operation or visualization. 
Invite a classmate or friend to collaborate on your Colab notebook. 
Provide their email address to send an invitation. 
Collaborate on a simple Python code project or data analysis task within the notebook. 
Save your Colab notebook to your Google Drive. 
Share the saved notebook with your instructor or a peer, allowing them to view or comment on your work.


Step by step procedure

Step 1: Install a Python Library
To install a library, use the `pip` command in a Colab notebook cell. Let's install `Matplotlib` as an example:

```python
!pip install matplotlib
```

Step 2: Demonstrate the Usage of the Installed Library
After installing `Matplotlib`, let's create a simple plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Basic data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]

# Create a plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X Axis")
plt.ylabel("Y Axis")
plt.show()
```

 Step 3: Invite a Classmate or Friend to Collaborate
To invite someone to collaborate:

1. Click the "Share" button in the upper-right corner of your Colab notebook.
2. Enter the email address of your classmate or friend.
3. Set their permissions (e.g., "Can edit") and click "Send".

 Step 4: Collaborate on a Simple Python Code Project
You can work together with your classmate or friend to add more features to the notebook, such as:

- Adding more data visualizations.
- Performing data analysis using `Pandas`.
- Implementing a simple machine learning model.

Step 5: Save the Colab Notebook to Google Drive
Your Colab notebook is automatically saved to your Google Drive. You can also manually save it by:

1. Going to `File` -> `Save a copy in Drive`.
2. Renaming the file if needed.

Step 6: Share the Saved Notebook
To share the saved notebook with your instructor or peer:

1. Open your Google Drive.
2. Find the saved Colab notebook.
3. Right-click on the notebook and select "Share".
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to share it with.
5. Set their permissions (e.g., "Can view" or "Can comment").
6. Click "Send".
